Exercise 7

Question 1
The loop runs from self.get_size()-1 to 0, inclusive. The loop iterates through each element of the list, so it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Inside the loop, the self.get_element_at_pos(i) operation is used to get the element at the current position. This operation has a time complexity of O(i), where i is the current position in the loop.

For each iteration, a new node (currNewNode) is created with the data of the corresponding element, and the node is inserted at the beginning of the new reversed list. This operation takes constant time for each iteration, so it's O(1) per iteration.

Finally, the self.head is updated to point to the new reversed list.

Now, let's analyze the total time complexity:

The loop runs n times, and for each iteration, the operations inside the loop take O(i) time. The worst-case scenario is when i is close to n/2 on average. Therefore, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n^2/4), which simplifies to O(n^2) in the worst case.

So, the expression for the time complexity of the provided reverse implementation is O(n^2). The quadratic time complexity arises from the nested loop structure, where the inner loop depends on the current position of the outer loop.



Question 2
def reverse(self):
    if self.head is None or self.head.next is None:
        # The list is empty or has only one element, no need to reverse
        return

    prev_node = None
    current_node = self.head
    next_node = None

    while current_node is not None:
        next_node = current_node.next
        current_node.next = prev_node
        prev_node = current_node
        current_node = next_node

    self.head = prev_node

Simplifying Node Creation:

The original implementation created new nodes for each element, leading to unnecessary overhead. In the optimized version, we reverse the links between existing nodes without creating new ones.
Two-Pointer Approach:

The optimized version uses a two-pointer approach with prev_node and next_node. This eliminates the need for iterating through the list in reverse order using indices.
Handling Edge Cases:

The optimized version includes a check for an empty list or a list with only one element. In such cases, reversing is not necessary, and the function returns early.
Efficient Link Reversal:

The core of the optimization is in the loop where we reverse the links between nodes. This is done by updating the next pointer of each node to point to the previous node.
The optimized implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is a significant improvement over the original implementation's O(n^2) time complexity. The space complexity remains O(1) as we are not using additional data structures proportional to the input size.

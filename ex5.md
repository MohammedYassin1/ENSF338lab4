1. timeit.repeat accounts for flunctuations in system preformance by taking the giving us the aggregate exuction times for each repetition. While timeit.timeit only accounts for one function call across multiple executions and returns the sum of those executions. This put less emphathise on the noise that could be cause by outside varriables.

2. For timeit.timeit, the approprite statistic would be average. This is because timeit.timeit gives total time for exectutions, which you would then divide by the number of executions to derive the average. Min, max or average would be approprite for timeit.repeat,this is because we could take the aveage for each to the total executions given by the timeit.repeat through the same method stated for timeit.timeit. Or iterate through the list of total execution times to find the min or max.
